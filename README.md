# Odin Admin Dashboard

This project is a responsive dashboard layout created to practice and showcase CSS Grid skills. The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience using Grid for layout design, focusing on its ability to create flexible and structured web layouts without relying on other layout methods like Flexbox.
